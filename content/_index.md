Hi! I'm **Carlo**. I like programming and pretty much anything that has to do with computers. At my day job I work on [compilers](https://www.graalvm.org/).
If I'm not writing code, you'll find me either making coffee, cooking, gaming, or out taking some photos.

If you care about what I have to say about programming and (occasionally) other topics, take a look at my [blog](/blog), or check out my [resume](https://github.com/CRefice/resume/releases/download/master/resume.pdf).
